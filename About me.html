                My name is Ayodele joseph, I am very passionate about coding,I love buliding from stratch, and completing it gives me a sense of fulfilment.
                I haven't always been a coder, prior to this I worked in health care, although i always wanted more for myself.I am still a newbee when it comes to coding,
                but i am a fast learner and I am always enthusiastic about gaining more knowledge to improve my skills. I love getting constructive feedbacks from fellow colleagues or supervisor.
                I love to take on new challenges because it often tests my limit.
